# Hello!

My name is Ion. I’ve been writing software for many years. I enjoy long walks in the forest and slow-poured coffee in the morning. I love my wife's laugh when I tell her I'm going to war and then disappear for hours at my laptop.

I previously worked as a quant developer at a hedge fund in London, then built and sold recruitment software. Currently, I'm travelling, enjoying life, and working on things I find interesting. Check out [aniko.ai](https://aniko.ai) and [firedust](https://github.com/ion2088/firedust).
